1、我们应当始终把“没有付出就没有收获”当作工作学习的座右铭。只有那些努力工作，不畏困难的人才能到达成功的顶峰。

To begin with, “No pains, no gains” should always be our motto in our life and work. Only those who are hard-working and brave enough to encounter difficulties of all sorts are most likely to reach the summit of success.

2、学习生活中我们肯定会遇到一些挫折。但一定要勇于面对，三思而后行。成功是一个过程，需要一步步地去实现。谚语说的好“罗马不是一天建成的”。简言之，努力工作的精神和面对现实的态度是通往成功的关键。

In terms of our life, work and study, we will meet lots of trials. We must always face reality and have a second thought before we make our final decision. Success is also a process and needs to be realized step by step. As a proverb goes “Rome was not built within a day”. In short, hard-working spirit and a realistic attitude lead to success.

3、年轻人只有经历更多的逆境，才能磨练出坚强的个性以及形成未来发展所需要的能力，也只有这样他们才能在这个竞争变化的世界最终取得成功。

Only by undergoing more adversities can young people develop strong personality and ability needed in the future, and only in this way can they eventually become winners in our competitive changing world.(倒装句式的使用)

4、坚持是我们保持精神向上的不可或缺的驱动力，并且能够帮助我们完成自己的学习和工作。

Persistence functions as an indispensable driving force to keep up our spirit and to assist us to fulfill our study and work.

5、在我看来，文化多样性对国家的发展和繁荣至关重要。

In my view, multicultures are extremely vital in ensuring a community's future development and prosperity.

6、教育对我们的生活至关重要，国家的可持续发展和繁荣昌盛依赖于对年轻一代的教育和培养。

It goes without saying that education plays an irreplaceable role in our life. The sustainable development and prosper of a nation depends on the education and cultivation of the young generation.

7、有关部门需要制定更多的法规，并将其贯彻实施，以惩罚破坏环境的行为。另外，

人们应该共同努力，来创建一个可持续的环境。

More regulations should be made and carried out by authorities concerned to punish environmental damage. In addition, individuals must work in joint efforts to create sustainable surroundings.

8、我认为，人类必须认识到自己是自然的一部分，自然的毁灭也意味着人类自身的灭亡。

I harbor the idea that it is of vital importance for people to realize that they are an integral part of nature, the destruction of which means the perishing of themselves.




第一套：

How enlightening and compelling the above drawing is!It is so funny that whoever sees it cannot help thinking:_____.(这句自己加完整，从宏观上 描述一下图画就可以，笼统的，大体的)______while_______.(这句从微观上具体说明 一下图画要描述的矛盾点，必须找到矛盾点，用到 while 这个单词)Simple as it looks,its intended meaning goes far deeper what on earth does the drawer really aim to convey. 

第二段： 

What the image above vividly mirrors goes far more than a simple image,instead,it carries a thought provoking social phenomenon:____.(本文的主旨)There are upsetting(如文章不是讽刺性的，就把 upsetting 删除)parallels today in our contemporary community. For example,______.(举 2 个例子，如果字数够就举 1 个) 

第三段： 

Much can be done. To begin with the schools and the mass media should develop,guide and cultivate noble and worthy values and qualities among people,doing their utmost to awaken people of the growing threat of this worsening situation.(of this worsening situation 自己可以换成主旨的词，如果不换，这样也可以。如文章不是讽刺性的，就把 worsening 删 除)What is more,the authorities concerned should play a dominant role in taking nationwide actions to curb(如文章不是讽刺性的，就把 curb 换成 promote)such practices.In conclusion,all the society should make actively more sustained and concerted efforts.Although we still have a long way to go,a promising start has begun,and a happy,healthy and harmonious society may be not be far behind.

第二套：

As is shown above, in the middle of the cartoon stands + 主题词， which symbolizes + 主题词的另一种表达，+ 同位语即主题词第三种表达 + 表示主题 词动作的非谓语动词. The drawer's intention seems to be highly self-evident and the meaning causes us to be thought-provoking. It is therefore safe to draw the conclusion that + 主题词 + is not a blessing but a curse. 

Not only I, but also the best poets and philosophers also insist that the problem has long plagued the people's social life. Obviously, I can think of no better reasons for the question other than the following two. Initially, human being’ s fearless curiosity about everything new has led some of them into this marsh. Additionally, our education in the harmfulness of this issue has been far from adequate to build the individuals ’sound resistance to this issue. Just as an old Arab proverbhas it, there is a growing tendency for the public in the west to think the significance of + 主题词. 

From what has been discussed above, the most important thing is not to say, but instead to do. Chinese citizens are expected to enhance their awareness that it is an indispensable part for the construction of harmonious society. The local and central authorities, not only chinese but also foreign ones, in coordination, are obliged to do something useful, only through these action can have a glorious future.

第三套：

As is shown above, in the middle of the cartoon stands + 主题词， which symbolizes + 主题词的另一种表达，+ 同位语即主题词第三种表达 + 表示主题 词动作的非谓语动词 (例如：in the middle of the cartoon stands a hot pot， which symbolizes culture，the one containing many Chinese culture symbol. The drawer's intention seems to be highly self-evident and the meaning causes us to be thought-provoking. It is therefore safe to draw the conclusion that + 主题词 + is momentous and fundamental to the mind what food is vital and significant to the body.) 

Not only I, but also the best philosophers and poets also praise that this concept should be a permanent universal values. Obviously, I can think of no better reasons for the phenomenon other than the followingtwo. Initially, the millennia-long run of + 主题词 + left us with a lot of traditions that are extremely profoundly rooted. 加拓展句：主题词 is a kind of emotional strength, which can support us no matter how dark around us becomes.(比如：爱心/自信/亲情/团结/坚持/诚信/友谊/乐观的态度/是一种情感的力量， 无论我们周围有多么的黑暗，它都能支持我们。) Additionally, our government's effective measures and policies are playing a significant role in the realization of such a situation(.加拓展句：without 主题句，the heart would break.上面的主题词都可以套进去，比如：没有爱心，心灵将会枯竭。) Just as an old Arab proverb has it, there is a growing tendency for the public in the west to think the significance of + 主题词. 

From what has been discussed above, the most important thing is not to say, but instead to do. Chinese citizens are expected to enhance their awareness that it is an indispensable part for the construction of harmonious society. Only in this way, can we /our country/ the individual have a glorious future.)

第四套：

一、 

As is shown in the picture(graph\cartoon\table), it goes without saying that the drawing aims at revealing a common problem(in China):______. It has attracted extensive attention of the society.Nowadays, increasingly more argumentations about it can be found in TV programs,newspapers,university classes and many aspects of our everyday life.Its status as the focus of public concern mainly results from its profound influence on individuals, collective and even the whole world. 

First of all, ______________is crucial for every individual.With its seemingly magic power, it can not only accelerate better individuals’ development, but serve as an efficient instrument for individuals to change the world. Those equipped with it are always admired and respected, because it may endow them with more competence, chances, self-confidence to overcome difficulties and handle problems.Those people appear to possess a special charm,bringing to others hope, passion and surprise,and,thus winning others’favor and trust.It can directly promote the rapid progress of the organization with its energy and indirectly spurs continuous development with the good culture it generates.Through continuously promoting the social productivity, unceasingly improving the productive relationship, and gradually enriching human material and spiritual wealth, ______________eventually brings economic prosperity and social harmony.

In short, where there is better______________, there are more hopes, vitality and development. When we are benefiting from it, we shall also do our utmost to maintain its vitality to ensure ourselves a brighter future.

二、 

As is vividly in the picture(s),it is a contemporary social issue in China of common interests and permanent value. The picture(s)does reflect a thought-provoking social phenomenon which is not uncommon nowadays.When weighing in the mind,we find an apparent tendency underlying this sight:_______________. 

Simple as it is,what the picture conveys to us is thought-provoking.With the development of economy and society, competition is becoming increasingly fierce.It is impossible for anyone to finish a task without .Hence, people in mounting numbers put great emphasis on .In fact, it has been universally acknowledged that the ability of s the most essential qualification that anyone who wants to achieve success should possess. Numerous examples can be given, but this will suffice. A case in point is the successful host of Beijing 2008 Olympic Games and the deadly earthquake in Si Chuan province.These cases effectively clarify that really counts in this competition society.

Accordingly, it is imperative for us to take some measures to enhance the sense of in our society. We should bear in mind that is of great significance to both our society and ourselves. Everyone should have the ability of______. Only in this way can we achieve success and only in this way can our society become more harmonious to live in.

第五套：

As is shown in the picture(graph\cartoon\table)，it goes without saying that the drawing aims at revealing a common problem(in China):______.Its status as the focus of public concern mainly results from its profound influence on individuals, collective and even the whole world. Each of us should attach high emphasis on solving it. 

As a matter of fact, the symbolic meaning the picture conveys is deep and profound. Naturally and necessarily, there are two major ways coping with this problem. The first way to tackle it is to appeal to authorities to take measures. Once achieving the success of solving the problem, the whole society also thrives/makes progress. Solving the problem can accelerate better individuals’development. The other way that is worth adopting is to work out new laws. Where there are better laws, there are more hopes, vitality and development. These advisable laws eventually brings economic prosperity and social harmony. Finally, I can safely come to the conclusion that it is high time we enhanced theawareness of people that is every vital to us. Only by these means can we succeed in solving the problem in the near future.(1 Therefore, measures should be taken to terminate the ridiculous affair. First and foremost, governments should establish some regulations to prohibit enterprises and people from making such misdeeds. What’s more, people should get ready to pass criticism upon such misdeeds anytime and anywhere. After all, it is necessary to develop our society by performing hard work instead of talking nonsense. 

In my opinion, it is imperative that we should take some drastic actions. On the one hand, we should appeal to our authorities to enact concrete laws to control commercial fishing. On the other hand, we should enhance people's awareness that ocean resources are vital to us and the ecological balance will be guaranteed with the strategy of sustainable development. Only by doing so can we effectively protect our natural resources. Also I am convinced that we humans can overcome this difficulty and we will have a bright future.) 

To conclude, we should not yield to mediocrity regardless of seemingly insurmountable obstacles. So the prospect we are looking forward to will be bright and encouraging.
